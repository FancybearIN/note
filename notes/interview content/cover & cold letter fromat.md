This achievement reinforced my skills in **DevOps, security automation, and scripting**, which align well with the responsibilities of this role.

I have secured over **20+ programs on Bugcrowd**, earning **Hall of Fame recognition from Cisco and OLX** for identifying vulnerabilities. My expertise in **CI/CD pipelines, cloud security, and automation tools** enables me to enhance system reliability. I am proficient in **Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Jenkins, Ansible, AWS, Bash, Python, and Node.js**, allowing me to streamline security and deployment processes.

I am eager to bring my **DevOps and security expertise** to your team and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills align with your objectives.
